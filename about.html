    <p>Originally known as <b>Clube Português de Sydney</b>, today’s Fraser Park was born in 1961, in Paddington by the hand of a small group of Portuguese migrants. Professional football players back in Portugal, like José Bento, Valdemaro and Vivaldo Pouco migrated to Australia hoping for a better life and integrated Fraser Park’s early teams. These young Portuguese migrants, and others who followed - Aderito (Andy) Marcos, Jose Domingos, Vitorino Rosa, Antonio Rendeiro and Silvio Mesquita (both founding club members) – would later become Fraser Park legends. In its first year, Clube Português de Sydney won its first official title: The All Age Gala Day, organised by Soccer NSW. This trophy still sits in the Clubhouse. </p>
    <p>The early 70’s was a period of success for Fraser Park (known as Rosebery Portuguese Club of Sydney at the time) when a generation of club legends was born. Paving the way for future soccer generations were names such as José Avelino, Big Ed, Mestre Chico, Luís Coelho, Faneca, Beckenbauer, Fonseca, Manuel and Jose Mestre, Johnny and Manuel Coelho and the coach Fernando Abinha.</p>
    <p>Fraser Park entries the Division 7 of the NSW Soccer Federation in 1982, winning a total of <b>4 championships</b> between 1982 and 1989 and finishing on the top 3 on other four occasions. The best striker of the club’s history took the lead during this period. Cecil, a young aboriginal kid, delighted Fraser Park fans who travelled all over Sydney to support their team. One Saturday afternoon match, that is still in our memories, Cecil scored 7 of the team’s 8 goals during a Federation Division 4 game.</p>
    <p>A scout from the old Sydney City (Hakoah) acknowledged Gerry Gomez’s talent during a match at Queens Park where he wore Fraser Parks colours. He ended up representing Australia in junior and senior levels and other Fraser Park players followed his footsteps, such as Clint Bolton and Ante Juric.</p>
    <p>Fraser Park won promotion to the NSW Division 1 and to the NSW Super League in 2000. In 2007, Fraser Park’s focus shifted to Association soccer, by bringing back members of the Social Community Club and integrating the inner-west community. Thus, the club increased the number of teams playing in Canterbury District to nearly 20, from age 6 to teams in the Men's and Women's All Age and Over 35 competitions.</p>
